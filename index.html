   <p>my hobby is coding.when i get free time i do my remaning projects or experiment with different tags and so on...let me explain what coding is.Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.and anyone can learn codingHave you ever met a coder who regretted learning to code? Probably not, because learning to code is fun and empowering! Coding also opens up a whole new community and network for you.Computers have their own language called Machine Code which tells them what to do. As you can see, it doesn't make a lot of sense to humans!

Each number or letter is telling the computer to change something in its memory. This could be a number or word, or a little part of a picture or video. By themselves, computers don't know how to do anything. It is the job of the programmer to give them instructions.
